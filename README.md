### Radar.ino
A simple and basic RADAR system that uses a 180 degree servo with an attached 3D printed frame to mount an Ultrasonic sensor to, uses an Arduino Uno and Processing to display graphics. Vulnerable to Gas/Volume interference.

### NVG.ino
A digital NVG system which would display thermal information to the user through a circular LCD display, the original IR camera module used was mistakenly bought as it only had an 8x8 grid, in the .ino file I have attempted interpolation to make 128x128 grid for added resolution. The circular LCD screen used is part of the AMG88xx series (replica). Temporary testing also used Processing to adjust temperature display colours.
